Business Understanding:

The data was information gathered from a direct telemarketing campaign that was implemented by the Portuguese banking institution.    To find out if a person would subscribe for the product, the client was often called more than once.  Building this model using the data provided would help for us know who will subscribe in the future and which attributes would drive a person’s decisions.   It will also reduce the questionaries’ once we have determined the decision drivers.

Deployment:
To properly compare the results of both models 150 test cases were imported and ran using the source code for each model.
